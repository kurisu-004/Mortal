      "    This module provides implementations of the riichi mahjong including the\n",
      "    following features:\n",
      "\n",
      "    - The core feature - player state maintenance driven by mjai events (via\n",
      "      `state.PlayerState`).\n",
      "    - Read mjai logs and produce a batch of instances for training (via\n",
      "      `dataset`).\n",
      "    - Self-play under standard Tenhou rules (via `arena`).\n",
      "    - Definitions of observation and action space for Mortal (via `consts`).\n",
      "    - Statistical works on mjai logs (via `stat.Stat`).\n",
      "    - mjai interface (via `mjai.Bot`).\n",
